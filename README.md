LLM evaluation framework

This project enables the creation of your own LLM evaluation framework against popular LLM providers (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI) and cloud providers (Google Cloud). See evals/test_evals.json for an example on how to build your own set of evaluations and test.py for execution. Update config.ini before running to enable APIs and services as needed.
